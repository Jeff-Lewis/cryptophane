<h1>Upload public key</h1>
<p>
Once you've generated your key pair, you're ready to make your public key available for anyone who wants to encrypt something to you. To do this, you must upload your public key to a public keyserver.
</p><p>
In Cryptophane it is a simple matter of selecting your public key from the key grid and then choosing the 'Send key to keyserver...' option which is available either by clicking the right mouse button on the key, or by selecting the option from the 'Keys' menu.
</p><p>
Now you're ready to start <a href="encrypt.html">encrypting</a> and <a href="decrypt.html">decrypting</a> messages and files.
