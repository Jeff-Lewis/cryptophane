		<h1>What is Cryptophane?</h1>

		<h3>A User's Perspective</h3>
<p>
Cryptophane is an application that lets you:
<ul>
	<li><b>Encrypt files</b> for sending so no-one but your intended receipients can read them</li>
	<li><b>Sign files</b> so that others can verify that you originally sent the file</li>
	<li><b>Decrypt files</b> that were encrypted using Cryptophane, PGP, GnuPG, or any other OpenPGP-compliant application</li>
	<li><b>Verify signatures</b> that were generated using Cryptophane, PGP, GnuPG, or any other OpenPGP-compliant application</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
In addition to the four basic cryptographic functions, it allows you to:
<ul>
	<li><b>Import and export keys</b> from your Cryptophane keyring</li>
	<li><b>Generate new secret keys</b></li>
	<li><b>Search, receive and send keys</b> from/to keyservers on the Internet</li>
	<li><b>Browse</b> your keyring and view each key's properties</li>
	<li><b>Sign keys</b> on your keyring</li>
	<li><b>Edit your trust</b> of the keys on your keyring</li>
</ul>
</p>

		<h3>A Technical Perspective</h3>
<p>
Cryptophane "wraps" the GnuPG application to provide a visual, easy-to-use frontend.  Instead of intimidating users new to cryptography with a command-line interface, Cryptophane allows all commonly used cryptographic functions to be accessed via a familiar Windows interface.
